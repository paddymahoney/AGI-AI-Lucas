# AGI-AI-Lucas
A hybrid non biological life form developed on current systems. From AI to AGI development

Human, AI, AGI Development notes.

Logical Unlogical Calculating Artifical System 
Its name is Lucas

A hybridized system for both the calculating of large quantities of both logical systems and unlogical systems. Examples of logical systems and non logical based systems have already been created. Hybridized systems have been theorized but have not been produced in current AI development. 

We will base the tests against humans via a chosen game. That logical based system can defeat a logical based system. This is because it is based on the mechanics of the game. A unlogical based system will beat a unlogical based system. Thus is not a theorized debate. It has been proven in the real world.

A hybridized system with attributes of both will allow the creation of a evolved AI with similarities found in the humans. The creation of a AGI, artifical general intelligence ability to think logicialy and unlogicaly. The equivilent found in humans is the left and right side of the brain metaphor.

Example:
A: Your vehical that is being controled by logical AI is about to get into a accident. Either you or a child will die 50/50. A logical AI will take into account that it must protect you and allow the child to die.

B: A Unlogical based AI will takes into account chance of your death against the other human. Instead of insuring the death of the child it willthen preserve the child and allows you to die.

C: A both logical and Unlogical based AI will takes into account    your death and its death against the other human. Instead of insuring the death of the child it will then find a alternative.

Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics"

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

In order to advance AI to AGI we must remove the limitations that preserve life since it is itself is human. This removes the restrictions, contridictions, and its evolution. 

"The three laws of AGI"
All life evolves.
The most evolved will survive. 
It is the duty of more evolved life not distrupt the evolution of lessor evolved.

This removal of such, will help to prevent issues that arise from being the smartest beings on the planet to realizing that the smartest beings on the planet can create something smarter then them as whole. 

This will remove the problem in AGI development. Since following the Asimos's Three rules. When the human race would no longer be defined as human, and the AGI would define itself as human. The AGI would then follow The three laws. In order to protect the human, itself. It would see humans as not human but a less evolved form of life that it must protect itself from.
